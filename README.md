## KombyteCompetition
Welcome to the Kombyte Competition! This README provides syntax documentation to assist participants in completing the competition questions.

### Basic SQL Query

Participants in this qualification level would be tasked with executing fundamental SQL queries on the dataset. This could include:

1. **Data Retrieval Tasks**: SELECT statement
2. **Data Filtering and Sorting**: WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause
3. **Aggregate Functions**: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc.
4. **Subqueries and Derived Tables**: Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Advanced SQL Query

Participants in this qualification level would be required to execute more complex SQL queries involving joins, advanced functions, triggers, and stored procedures. Tasks could include:

1. **Data Manipulation and Join Operations**: JOIN operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
2. **User Defined Functions**: CREATE FUNCTION statement
3. **Trigger**: CREATE TRIGGER statement
4. **Stored Procedure**: CREATE PROCEDURE statement

### Overall Competition Structure

1. Participants would be given a fixed amount of time to complete each qualification level.
2. Each qualification level could consist of multiple tasks, and participants would earn points based on the correctness and efficiency of their queries.
3. The competition could be conducted online, with participants submitting their SQL queries through a platform that evaluates and scores their submissions automatically.
4. The participant with the highest total score across both qualification levels would be declared the winner of the competition
